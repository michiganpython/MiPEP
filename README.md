# Michigan Python Community Introduction

# Vision
An open community of Python enthusiasts who pursue Python mastery and seek to contribute to the mission of the global Python community.

# Organization
Michigan Python is an open-source organization organized on [Github](https://github.com/MichiganPython) and [Slack](http://bit.ly/join-mipy). That means that you can submit a pull request to modify the organization at any time and we will decide if we want to incorporate your ideas into the community. [See Contributing](#Contributing)

# Sponsorship
To fulfill our vision for this group, we have  company sponsorship as well as *optional* member contributions. Companies and members who contribute will be recognized for their contribution at every meeting. Sponsorship is handled at [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/michiganpython) (*All expenses for the community are public on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/michiganpython) as well*).

# Meetings
The group meets at least once a month for a presentation by a member (or honorary members from the global Python community). Meetings are our chance to catch up with other members in person and learn something from the presenter. Meetings are organized on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Michigan-Python-MiPy/). 

# Community
We mainly connect outside of meetings on Slack. [Join the Michigan Python Slack community](http://bit.ly/join-mipy). On Slack, we discuss MiPy itself, help each other with Python problems, and anything else you'd like to do! You can also connect with the community on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MichiganPython) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/MichiganPython). 

# Roles
There are many roles for the group. Every member is encouraged to select a roles for themselves as a way to contribute to the community. Possible roles include: Host, Greeter, Chef, Photographer, Videographer, Treasurer, Organizer, Lead Organizer, Promoter, or any other role that you suggest.

# Golden Rule
We follow the golden rule: treat others how you'd like to be treated. Michigan Python is an open community, but we will exclude those who refuse to follow the golden rule.
